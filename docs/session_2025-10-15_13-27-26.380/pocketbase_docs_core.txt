Category: general

Content:
Introduction  Please keep in mind that PocketBase is still under active development and full backward
compatibility is not guaranteed before reaching v1.0.0. PocketBase is NOT recommended for
production critical applications yet, unless you are fine with reading the
and applying some manual migration steps from time to time.
PocketBase is an open source backend consisting of embedded database (SQLite) with realtime subscriptions,
builtin auth management, convenient dashboard UI and simple REST-ish API. It can be used both as Go
framework and as standalone application.
See the
for other platforms and more details.
Once you&#39;ve extracted the archive, you could start the application by running
./pocketbase serve in the extracted directory.
And that&#39;s it!
The first time it will generate an installer link that should be automatically opened in the browser to set
up your first superuser account
(you can also create the first superuser manually via
./pocketbase superuser create EMAIL PASS)
The started web server has the following default routes:
-http://127.0.0.1:8090
- if pb_public directory exists, serves the static content from it (html, css, images,
etc.)
-http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/
- superusers dashboard
-http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/
- REST-ish API
The prebuilt PocketBase executable will create and manage 2 new directories alongside the executable:
-pb_data - stores your application data, uploaded files, etc. (usually should be added in
.gitignore).
-pb_migrations - contains JS migration files with your collection changes (can be safely
committed in your repository).
You can even write custom migration scripts. For more info check the
JS migrations docs.
You could find all available commands and their options by running
./pocketbase --help or
./pocketbase [command] --help

[2] How to use PocketBase
URL: https://pocketbase.io/docs/how-to-use/
Category: general

Content:
How to use PocketBase The easiest way to use PocketBase is by interacting with its Web APIs directly from the client-side (e.g.
mobile app or browser SPA).
It was designed with this exact use case in mind and it is also the reason why there are general purpose
JSON APIs for listing, pagination, sorting, filtering, etc.
The access and filter controls for your data are usually done through the
collection API rules
For the cases when you need more specialized handling (sending emails, intercepting the default actions,
creating new routes, etc.) you can
extend PocketBase with Go or JavaScript
For interacting with the
Web APIs
you can make use of the official SDK clients:
-JavaScript SDK (Browser, Node.js, React Native)
-Dart SDK (Web, Mobile, Desktop, CLI)
When used on the client-side, it is safe to have a single/global SDK instance for the entire lifecycle of
your application.
Web apps recommendation    Not everyone will agree with this, but if you are building a web app with PocketBase I recommend
developing the frontend as a traditional client-side SPA and for the cases where additional
server-side handling is needed (e.g. for payment webhooks, extra data server validations, etc.) you
could try to:
-Use PocketBase as Go/JS framework to create new routes or
intercept existing.
-Create one-off Node.js/Bun/Deno/etc. server-side actions that will interact with
PocketBase only as superuser and as pure data store (similar to traditional database
interactions but over HTTP). In this case it is safe to have a global superuser client
such as:
// src/superuser.js
import PocketBase from "pocketbase"
// disable autocancellation so that we can handle async requests from multiple users
superuserClient.autoCancellation(false);
// option 1: authenticate as superuser using email/password (could be filled with ENV params)
await superuserClient.collection('_superusers').authWithPassword(SUPERUSER_EMAIL, SUPERUSER_PASS, {
// This will trigger auto refresh or auto reauthentication in case
autoRefreshThreshold: 30 * 60
// option 2: OR authenticate as superuser via long-lived "API key"
// (see https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/#api-keys)
superuserClient.authStore.save('YOUR_GENERATED_SUPERUSER_TOKEN')
export default superuserClient;  Then you can directly import the file in your server-side actions and use the client as
usual:
import superuserClient from './src/superuser.js'
async function serverAction(req, resp) {
... do some extra data validations or handling ...
// send a create request as superuser
await superuserClient.collection('example').create({ ... })
in a JS SSR mode
is possible but it comes with many complications and you need to carefully evaluate whether the cost
of having another backend (PocketBase) alongside your existing one (the Node.js server) is worth it.
JS SSR - issues and recommendations #5313 but some of the common pitfalls are:
-Security issues caused by incorrectly initialized and shared JS SDK instance in a long-running
server-side context.
-OAuth2 integration difficulties related to the server-side only OAuth2 flow (or its mixed
&quot;all-in-one&quot; client-side handling and sharing a cookie with the server-side).
-Proxying realtime connections and essentially duplicating the same thing PocketBase already
does.
-Performance bottlenecks caused by the default single-threaded Node.js process and the
excessive resources utilization due to the server-side rendering and heavy back-and-forth
requests communication between the different layers (client&lt;->Node.js&lt;->PocketBase).
This doesn&#39;t mean that using PocketBase with JS SSR is always a &quot;bad thing&quot; but based on the
dozens reported issues so far I would recommend it only after careful evaluation and only to more
experienced developers that have in-depth understanding of the used tools and their trade-offs. If
you still want to use PocketBase to handle regular users authentication with a JS SSR meta
framework, then you can find some JS SDK examples in the repo&#39;s
JS SSR integration section
Why not htmx, Hotwire/Turbo, Unpoly, etc.    htmx, Hotwire/Turbo, Unpoly and other similar tools are commonly used for building server rendered
applications but unfortunately they don&#39;t play well with the JSON APIs and fully stateless nature
of PocketBase.
It is possible to use them with PocketBase but at the moment I don&#39;t recommend it because we lack
the necessary helpers and utilities for building SSR-first applications, which means that you
might have to create from scratch a lot of things on your own such as middlewares for handling
cookies (and eventually also taking care of CORS and CSRF) or custom authentication
endpoints and access controls (the collection API rules apply only for the builtin JSON routes).
In the future we could eventually provide official SSR support in terms of guides and middlewares
for this use case but again - PocketBase wasn&#39;t designed with this in mind and you may want to
reevaluate the tech stack of your application and switch to a traditional client-side SPA as
mentioned earlier or use a different backend solution that might fit better with your use case.
Mobile apps auth persistence    When building mobile apps with the JavaScript SDK or Dart SDK you&#39;ll have to specify a custom
persistence store if you want to preserve the authentication between the various app activities
and open/close state.
The SDKs come with a helper async storage implementation that allows you to hook any custom
persistent layer (local file, SharedPreferences, key-value based database, etc.). Here is a
minimal PocketBase SDKs initialization for React Native (JavaScript) and Flutter (Dart):
Dart  // Node.js and React Native doesn't have native EventSource implementation
// so in order to use the realtime subscriptions you'll need to load EventSource polyfill,
// for example: npm install react-native-sse --save
import eventsource from 'react-native-sse';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import PocketBase, { AsyncAuthStore } from 'pocketbase';
// load the polyfill
global.EventSource = eventsource;
// initialize the async store
const store = new AsyncAuthStore({
save:    async (serialized) => AsyncStorage.setItem('pb_auth', serialized),
initial: AsyncStorage.getItem('pb_auth'),
// initialize the PocketBase client
// (it is OK to have a single/global instance for the duration of your application)
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090', store);
console.log(pb.authStore.record)  import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
// for simplicity we are using a simple SharedPreferences instance
// but you can also replace it with its safer EncryptedSharedPreferences alternative
final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
// initialize the async store
final store = AsyncAuthStore(
save:    (String data) async => prefs.setString('pb_auth', data),
initial: prefs.getString('pb_auth'),
// initialize the PocketBase client
// (it is OK to have a single/global instance for the duration of your application)
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090', authStore: store);
print(pb.authStore.record);      React Native file upload on Android and iOS    At the time of writing, React Native on Android and iOS seems to have a non-standard
FormData implementation and for uploading files on these platforms it requires the following
special object syntax:
uri: "...",
type: "...",
name: "..."
}  Or in other words, you may have to apply a conditional handling similar to:
const data = new FormData();
// result is the resolved promise of ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync
let imageUri = result.assets[0].uri;
if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
const req = await fetch(imageUri);
const blob = await req.blob();
data.append('avatar', blob); // regular File/Blob value
} else {
// the below object format works only on Android and iOS
// (FormData.set() also doesn't seem to be supported so we use FormData.append())
data.append('avatar', {
uri:  imageUri,
type: 'image/*',
name: imageUri.split('/').pop(),
collections, records, authentication, relations, files handling, etc.

# Going to production
Going to production  ### Deployment strategies
##### Minimal setup
One of the best PocketBase features is that it&#39;s completely portable. This means that it doesn&#39;t require
any external dependency and
could be deployed by just uploading the executable on your server.
Here is an example of starting a production HTTPS server (auto managed TLS with Let&#39;s Encrypt) on a clean
Ubuntu 22.04 installation.
-Consider the following app directory structure:
myapp/
pb_migrations/
pb_hooks/
pocketbase
-Upload the binary and anything else required by your application to your remote server, for
example using
rsync:
rsync -avz -e ssh /local/path/to/myapp root@YOUR_SERVER_IP:/root/pb
-Start a SSH session with your server:
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
-Start the executable (specifying a domain name will issue a Let&#39;s encrypt certificate for it)
[root@dev ~]$ /root/pb/pocketbase serve yourdomain.com  Notice that in the above example we are logged in as root which allows us to
bind to the
privileged 80 and 443 ports.
For non-root users usually you&#39;ll need special privileges to be able to do
that. You have several options depending on your OS - authbind,
setcap,
iptables, sysctl, etc. Here is an example using setcap:
[myuser@dev ~]$ sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /root/pb/pocketbase
-(Optional) Systemd service
You can skip step 3 and create a Systemd service
to allow your application to start/restart on its own.
Here is an example service file (usually created in
/lib/systemd/system/pocketbase.service):
[Unit]
Description = pocketbase
[Service]
Type             = simple
User             = root
Group            = root
LimitNOFILE      = 4096
Restart          = always
RestartSec       = 5s
StandardOutput   = append:/root/pb/std.log
StandardError    = append:/root/pb/std.log
WorkingDirectory = /root/pb
ExecStart        = /root/pb/pocketbase serve yourdomain.com
[Install]
WantedBy = multi-user.target  After that we just have to enable it and start the service using systemctl:
[root@dev ~]$ systemctl enable pocketbase.service
[root@dev ~]$ systemctl start pocketbase  You can find a link to the Web UI installer in the /root/pb/std.log, but
alternatively you can also create the first superuser explicitly via the
superuser PocketBase command:
[root@dev ~]$ /root/pb/pocketbase superuser create EMAIL PASS
##### Using reverse proxy
If you plan on hosting multiple applications on a single server or need finer network controls, you can
always put PocketBase behind a reverse proxy such as
NGINX, Apache, Caddy, etc.
Just note that when using a reverse proxy you may need to set up the &quot;User IP proxy headers&quot; in the
PocketBase settings so that the application can extract and log the actual visitor/client IP (the
headers are usually X-Real-IP, X-Forwarded-For).
Here is a minimal NGINX example configuration:
server {
listen 80;
client_max_body_size 10M;
location / {
# check http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#keepalive
proxy_set_header Connection '';
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_read_timeout 360s;
proxy_set_header Host $host;
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
# enable if you are serving under a subpath location
# rewrite /yourSubpath/(.*) /$1  break;
proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8090;
}  Corresponding Caddy configuration is:
request_body {
max_size 10MB
reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8090 {
transport http {
read_timeout 360s
}  ##### Using Docker
Some hosts (e.g. fly.io) use Docker
for deployments. PocketBase doesn&#39;t have an official Docker image, but you could use the below minimal
Dockerfile as an example:
FROM alpine:latest
ARG PB_VERSION=0.30.2
RUN apk add --no-cache \
unzip \
ca-certificates
# uncomment to copy the local pb_migrations dir into the image
# COPY ./pb_migrations /pb/pb_migrations
# uncomment to copy the local pb_hooks dir into the image
# COPY ./pb_hooks /pb/pb_hooks
EXPOSE 8080
# start PocketBase
CMD ["/pb/pocketbase", "serve", "--http=0.0.0.0:8080"]  To persist your data you need to mount a volume at /pb/pb_data.
For a full example you could check the
&quot;Host for free on Fly.io&quot;
guide.
### Backup and Restore
To backup/restore your application it is enough to manually copy/replace your pb_data
directory
(for transactional safety make sure that the application is not running).
To make things slightly easier, PocketBase v0.16+ comes with builtin backups and restore APIs that could
be accessed from the Dashboard (
Settings > Backups
Backups can be stored locally (default) or in a S3 compatible storage (it is recommended to use a separate bucket only for the backups). The generated backup represents a full snapshot as ZIP archive of your pb_data directory (including
the locally stored uploaded files but excluding any local backups or files uploaded to S3).
During the backup&#39;s ZIP generation the application will be temporary set in read-only mode.
Depending on the size of your pb_data this could be a very slow operation and it is
advised in case of large pb_data (e.g. 2GB+) to consider a different backup strategy
(see an example
backup.sh script
that combines sqlite3 .backup + rsync)
### Recommendations
By default, PocketBase uses the internal Unix sendmail command for sending emails.
While it&#39;s OK for development, it&#39;s not very useful for production, because your emails most likely will get
marked as spam or even fail to deliver.
To avoid deliverability issues, consider using a local SMTP server or an external mail service like
MailerSend,
Brevo,
SendGrid,
Mailgun,
AWS SES, etc.
Once you&#39;ve decided on a mail service, you could configure the PocketBase SMTP settings from the
Dashboard > Settings > Mail settings :
As an additional layer of security you can enable the MFA and OTP options for the _superusers
collection, which will enforce an additional one-time password (email code) requirement when authenticating
as superuser.
In case of email deliverability issues, you can also generate an OTP manually using the
To minimize the risk of API abuse (e.g. excessive auth or record create requests) it is recommended to set
up a rate limiter.
PocketBase v0.23.0+ comes with a simple builtin rate limiter that should cover most of the cases but you
are also free to use any external one via reverse proxy if you need more advanced options.
You can configure the builtin rate limiter from the
Dashboard > Settings > Application:
Unix uses &quot;file descriptors&quot; also for network connections and most systems have a default limit
of ~ 1024.
If your application has a lot of concurrent realtime connections, it is possible that at some point you would
get an error such as: Too many open files.
One way to mitigate this is to check your current account resource limits by running
ulimit -a and find the parameter you want to change. For example, if you want to increase the
open files limit (-n), you could run
ulimit -n 4096 before starting PocketBase.
If you are running in a memory constrained environment, defining the
GOMEMLIMIT
environment variable could help preventing out-of-memory (OOM) termination of your process. It is a &quot;soft limit&quot;
meaning that the memory usage could still exceed it in some situations, but it instructs the GC to be more
&quot;aggressive&quot; and run more often if needed. For example: GOMEMLIMIT=512MiB.
If after GOMEMLIMIT you are still experiencing OOM errors, you can try to enable swap
partitioning (if not already) or open a
Q&amp;A discussion
with some steps to reproduce the error in case it is something that we can improve in PocketBase.
It is fine to ignore the below if you are not sure whether you need it.
By default, PocketBase stores the applications settings in the database as plain JSON text, including the
SMTP password and S3 storage credentials.
While this is not a security issue on its own (PocketBase applications live entirely on a single server
and it is expected only authorized users to have access to your server and application data), in some
situations it may be a good idea to store the settings encrypted in case someone get their hands on your
database file (e.g. from an external stored backup).
To store your PocketBase settings encrypted:
-Create a new environment variable and set a random 32 characters string as its value.
e.g. add
export PB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=&quot;mqnMUCRxQ9BHLB1QIzpsFxzX6IxWtkEU&quot;
in your shell profile file
-Start the application with --encryptionEnv=YOUR_ENV_VAR flag.
e.g. pocketbase serve --encryptionEnv=PB_ENCRYPTION_KEY

[11] Introduction - Collections
URL: https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/
Category: database

Content:
- Collections
Collections  ### Overview
Collections represent your application data. Under the hood they are backed by plain
SQLite tables that are generated automatically with the collection
name and fields (columns).
Single entry of a collection is called record (a single row in the SQL table).
You can manage your collections from the Dashboard, with the Web APIs using the
client-side SDKs
(superusers only) or programmatically via the
Go/JavaScript
migrations.
Similarly, you can manage your records from the Dashboard, with the Web APIs using the
client-side SDKs
or programmatically via the
Go/JavaScript
Record operations.
Here is what a collection edit panel looks like in the Dashboard:
Currently there are 3 collection types: Base, View and
Auth.
##### Base collection
Base collection is the default collection type and it could be used to store any application
data (articles, products, posts, etc.).
##### View collection
View collection is a read-only collection type where the data is populated from a plain
SQL SELECT statement, allowing users to perform aggregations or any other custom queries in
general.
For example, the following query will create a read-only collection with 3 posts
fields - id, name and totalComments:
SELECT
posts.id,
posts.name,
count(comments.id) as totalComments
FROM posts
LEFT JOIN comments on comments.postId = posts.id
GROUP BY posts.id   View collections don&#39;t receive realtime events because they don&#39;t have create/update/delete
operations. ##### Auth collection
Auth collection has everything from the Base collection but with some additional
special fields to help you manage your app users and also provide various authentication options.
Each Auth collection has the following special system fields:
email, emailVisibility, verified,
password and tokenKey.
They cannot be renamed or deleted but can be configured using their specific field options. For example you
can make the user email required or optional.
You can have as many Auth collections as you want (users, managers, staffs, members, clients, etc.) each
with their own set of fields, separate login and records managing endpoints.
You can build all sort of different access controls:
-Role (Group)  For example, you could attach a &quot;role&quot; select field to your Auth collection with the
following options: &quot;employee&quot; and &quot;staff&quot;. And then in some of your other collections you could
define the following rule to allow only &quot;staff&quot;:
@request.auth.role = &quot;staff&quot;
-Relation (Ownership)  Let&#39;s say that you have 2 collections - &quot;posts&quot; base collection and &quot;users&quot; auth collection. In
your &quot;posts&quot; collection you can create &quot;author&quot;
relation field pointing to the &quot;users&quot; collection. To allow access to only the
&quot;author&quot; of the record(s), you could use a rule like:
@request.auth.id != &quot;&quot; &amp;&amp; author = @request.auth.id
Nested relation fields look ups, including back-relations, are also supported, for example:
someRelField.anotherRelField.author = @request.auth.id
-Managed  In addition to the default &quot;List&quot;, &quot;View&quot;, &quot;Create&quot;, &quot;Update&quot;, &quot;Delete&quot; API rules, Auth
collections have also a special &quot;Manage&quot; API rule that could be used to allow one user (it could
be even from a different collection) to be able to fully manage the data of another user (e.g.
changing their email, password, etc.).
-Mixed  You can build a mixed approach based on your unique use-case. Multiple rules can be grouped with
parenthesis () and combined with &amp;&amp;
(AND) and || (OR) operators:
@request.auth.id != &quot;&quot; &amp;&amp; (@request.auth.role = &quot;staff&quot; || author = @request.auth.id)
### Fields
All collection fields (with exception of the JSONField) are
non-nullable and use a zero-default for their respective type as fallback value
when missing (empty string for text, 0 for number, etc.).
All field specific modifiers are supported both in the Web APIs and via the record Get/Set
methods.
BoolField    BoolField defines bool type field to store a single false
(default) or true value.
NumberField    NumberField defines number type field for storing numeric/float64 value:
0 (default), 2, -1, 1.5.
The following additional set modifiers are available:
-fieldName+
adds number to the already existing record value.
-fieldName-
subtracts number from the already existing record value.
TextField    TextField defines text type field for storing string values:
&quot;&quot; (default), &quot;example&quot;.
The following additional set modifiers are available:
-fieldName:autogenerate
autogenerate a field value if the AutogeneratePattern field option is set.
For example, submitting:
{"slug:autogenerate":"abc-"} will result in &quot;abc-[random]&quot; slug field value.
EmailField    EmailField defines email type field for storing a single email string address:
URLField    URLField defines url type field for storing a single URL string value:
EditorField    EditorField defines editor type field to store HTML formatted text:
&quot;&quot; (default), &lt;p>example&lt;/p>.
DateField    DateField defines date type field to store a single datetime string value:
&quot;&quot; (default), &quot;2022-01-01 00:00:00.000Z&quot;.
All PocketBase dates at the moment follows the RFC3399 format Y-m-d H:i:s.uZ
(e.g. 2024-11-10 18:45:27.123Z).
Dates are compared as strings, meaning that when using the filters with a date field you&#39;ll
have to specify the full datetime string format. For example to target a single day (e.g.
November 19, 2024) you can use something like:
created >= '2024-11-19 00:00:00.000Z' &amp;&amp; created &lt;= '2024-11-19 23:59:59.999Z'
AutodateField    AutodateField defines an autodate type field and it is similar to the DateField but
its value is auto set on record create/update.
This field is usually used for defining timestamp fields like &quot;created&quot; and &quot;updated&quot;.
SelectField    SelectField defines select type field for storing single or multiple string values
from a predefined list.
It is usually intended for handling enums-like values such as
pending/public/private
statuses, simple client/staff/manager/admin roles, etc.
For single select (the MaxSelect option is &lt;= 1)
the field value is a string:
&quot;&quot;, &quot;optionA&quot;.
For multiple select (the MaxSelect option is >= 2)
the field value is an array:
[], [&quot;optionA&quot;, &quot;optionB&quot;].
The following additional set modifiers are available:
-fieldName+
appends one or more values to the existing one.
-+fieldName
prepends one or more values to the existing one.
-fieldName-
subtracts/removes one or more values from the existing one.
For example: {"permissions+": "optionA", "roles-": ["staff", "editor"]}
FileField    FileField defines file type field for managing record file(s).
PocketBase stores in the database only the file name. The file itself is stored either on the
local disk or in S3, depending on your application storage settings.
For single file (the MaxSelect option is &lt;= 1)
the stored value is a string:
&quot;&quot;, &quot;file1_Ab24ZjL.png&quot;.
For multiple file (the MaxSelect option is >= 2)
the stored value is an array:
[], [&quot;file1_Ab24ZjL.png&quot;, &quot;file2_Frq24ZjL.txt&quot;].
The following additional set modifiers are available:
-fieldName+
appends one or more files to the existing field value.
-+fieldName
prepends one or more files to the existing field value.
-fieldName-
deletes one or more files from the existing field value.
For example:
{"documents+": new File(...), "documents-": ["file1_Ab24ZjL.txt", "file2_Frq24ZjL.txt"]}
You can find more detailed information in the
Files upload and handling guide.
RelationField    RelationField defines relation type field for storing single or multiple collection
record references.
For single relation (the MaxSelect option is &lt;= 1)
the field value is a string:
&quot;&quot;, &quot;RECORD_ID&quot;.
For multiple relation (the MaxSelect option is >= 2)
the field value is an array:
[], [&quot;RECORD_ID1&quot;, &quot;RECORD_ID2&quot;].
The following additional set modifiers are available:
-fieldName+
appends one or more ids to the existing one.
-+fieldName
prepends one or more ids to the existing one.
-fieldName-
subtracts/removes one or more ids from the existing one.
For example: {"users+": "USER_ID", "categories-": ["CAT_ID1", "CAT_ID2"]}
JSONField    JSONField defines json type field for storing any serialized JSON value,
including null (default).
GeoPoint    GeoPoint defines geoPoint type field for storing geographic coordinates
(longitude, latitude) as a serialized json object. For example:
{"lon":12.34,"lat":56.78}.
The default/zero value of a geoPoint is the &quot;Null Island&quot;, aka.
{"lon":0,"lat":0}.
When extending PocketBase with Go/JSVM, the geoPoint field value could be set as
types.GeoPoint instance or a regular map with lon and
lat keys:
JavaScript  // set types.GeoPoint
record.Set("address", types.GeoPoint{Lon:12.34, Lat:45.67})
// set map[string]any
record.Set("address", map[string]any{"lon":12.34, "lat":45.67})
// retrieve the field value as types.GeoPoint struct
address := record.GetGeoPoint("address")  record.set("address", {"lon":12.34, "lat":45.67})
const address = record.get("address")

API Rules are your collection access controls and data filters.
Each collection has 5 rules, corresponding to the specific API action:
-listRule
-viewRule
-createRule
-updateRule
-deleteRule
Auth collections have an additional options.manageRule used to allow one user (it could be even
from a different collection) to be able to fully manage the data of another user (ex. changing their email,
password, etc.).
Each rule could be set to:
-&quot;locked&quot; - aka. null, which means that the action could be performed
only by an authorized superuser
(this is the default)
-Empty string - anyone will be able to perform the action (superusers, authorized users
and guests)
-Non-empty string - only users (authorized or not) that satisfy the rule filter expression
will be able to perform this action
PocketBase API Rules act also as records filter!
Or in other words, you could for example allow listing only the &quot;active&quot; records of your collection,
by using a simple filter expression such as:
status = &quot;active&quot;
(where &quot;status&quot; is a field defined in your Collection).
Because of the above, the API will return 200 empty items response in case a request doesn&#39;t
satisfy a listRule, 400 for unsatisfied createRule and 404 for
unsatisfied viewRule, updateRule and deleteRule.
All rules will return 403 in case they were &quot;locked&quot; (aka. superuser only) and the request client is
not a superuser.
The API Rules are ignored when the action is performed by an authorized superuser (superusers can access everything)!
### Filters syntax
You can find information about the available fields in your collection API rules tab:
There is autocomplete to help guide you while typing the rule filter expression, but in general you have
access to 3 groups of fields:
-Your Collection schema fields
This includes all nested relation fields too, ex.
someRelField.status != &quot;pending&quot;
-@request.*
Used to access the current request data, such as query parameters, body/form fields, authorized user state,
etc.
@request.context - the context where the rule is used (ex.
@request.context != &quot;oauth2&quot;)
The currently supported context values are
default,
oauth2,
otp,
password,
realtime,
protectedFile.
-@request.method - the HTTP request method (ex.
@request.method = &quot;GET&quot;)
-@request.headers.* - the request headers as string values (ex.
@request.headers.x_token = &quot;test&quot;)
Note: All header keys are normalized to lowercase and &quot;-&quot; is replaced with &quot;_&quot; (for
example &quot;X-Token&quot; is &quot;x_token&quot;).
-@request.query.* - the request query parameters as string values (ex.
@request.query.page = &quot;1&quot;)
-@request.auth.* - the current authenticated model (ex.
@request.auth.id != &quot;&quot;)
-@request.body.* - the submitted body parameters (ex.
@request.body.title != &quot;&quot;)
Note: Uploaded files are not part of the @request.body
because they are evaluated separately (this behavior may change in the future).
-@collection.* This filter could be used to target other collections that are not directly related to the current
one (aka. there is no relation field pointing to it) but both shares a common field value, like
for example a category id:
@collection.news.categoryId ?= categoryId &amp;&amp; @collection.news.author ?= @request.auth.id  In case you want to join the same collection multiple times but based on different criteria, you
can define an alias by appending :alias suffix to the collection name.
// see https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/discussions/3805#discussioncomment-7634791
@request.auth.id != "" &amp;&amp;
@collection.courseRegistrations.user ?= id &amp;&amp;
@collection.courseRegistrations:auth.user ?= @request.auth.id &amp;&amp;
@collection.courseRegistrations.courseGroup ?= @collection.courseRegistrations:auth.courseGroup
The syntax basically follows the format
OPERAND OPERATOR OPERAND, where:
-OPERAND - could be any field literal, string (single or double quoted),
number, null, true, false
-OPERATOR - is one of:
= Equal
-!= NOT equal
-> Greater than
->= Greater than or equal
-&lt; Less than
-&lt;= Less than or equal
-~ Like/Contains (if not specified auto wraps the right string OPERAND in a &quot;%&quot; for wildcard
match)
-!~ NOT Like/Contains (if not specified auto wraps the right string OPERAND in a &quot;%&quot; for
wildcard match)
-?= Any/At least one of Equal
-?!= Any/At least one of NOT equal
-?> Any/At least one of Greater than
-?>= Any/At least one of Greater than or equal
-?&lt; Any/At least one of Less than
-?&lt;= Any/At least one of Less than or equal
-?~ Any/At least one of Like/Contains (if not specified auto wraps the right string OPERAND in a &quot;%&quot; for wildcard
match)
-?!~ Any/At least one of NOT Like/Contains (if not specified auto wraps the right string OPERAND in a &quot;%&quot; for
wildcard match)
To group and combine several expressions you can use parenthesis
(...), &amp;&amp; (AND) and || (OR) tokens.
Single line comments are also supported: // Example comment.
### Special identifiers and modifiers
##### @ macros
The following datetime macros are available and can be used as part of the filter expression:
// all macros are UTC based
@now        - the current datetime as string
@second     - @now second number (0-59)
@minute     - @now minute number (0-59)
@hour       - @now hour number (0-23)
@weekday    - @now weekday number (0-6)
@day        - @now day number
@month      - @now month number
@year       - @now year number
@yesterday  - the yesterday datetime relative to @now as string
@tomorrow   - the tomorrow datetime relative to @now as string
@todayStart - beginning of the current day as datetime string
@todayEnd   - end of the current day as datetime string
@monthStart - beginning of the current month as datetime string
@monthEnd   - end of the current month as datetime string
@yearStart  - beginning of the current year as datetime string
@yearEnd    - end of the current year as datetime string  For example:
`@request.body.publicDate >= @now`  ##### :isset modifier
The :isset field modifier is available only for the @request.* fields and can be
used to check whether the client submitted a specific data with the request. Here is for example a rule that
disallows changing a &quot;role&quot; field:
`@request.body.role:isset = false`  Note that @request.body.*:isset at the moment doesn&#39;t support checking for
new uploaded files because they are evaluated separately and cannot be serialized (this behavior may change in the future).
##### :length modifier
The :length field modifier could be used to check the number of items in an array field
(multiple file, select, relation).
Could be used with both the collection schema fields and the @request.body.* fields. For example:
// check example submitted data: {"someSelectField": ["val1", "val2"]}
@request.body.someSelectField:length > 1
// check existing record field length
someRelationField:length = 2  Note that @request.body.*:length at the moment doesn&#39;t support checking
for new uploaded files because they are evaluated separately and cannot be serialized (this behavior may change in the future).
##### :each modifier
The :each field modifier works only with multiple select, file and
relation
type fields. It could be used to apply a condition on each item from the field array. For example:
// check if all submitted select options contain the "create" text
@request.body.someSelectField:each ~ "create"
// check if all existing someSelectField has "pb_" prefix
someSelectField:each ~ "pb_%"  Note that @request.body.*:each at the moment doesn&#39;t support checking for
new uploaded files because they are evaluated separately and cannot be serialized (this behavior may change in the future).
##### :lower modifier
The :lower field modifier could be used to perform lower-case string comparisons. For example:
// check if the submitted lower-cased body "title" field is equal to "test" ("Test", "tEsT", etc.)
@request.body.title:lower = "test"
// match existing records with lower-cased "title" equal to "test" ("Test", "tEsT", etc.)
title:lower ~ "test"  Under the hood it uses the
SQLite LOWER scalar function
and by default works only for ASCII characters, unless the ICU extension is loaded.
##### geoDistance(lonA, latA, lonB, latB)
The geoDistance(lonA, latA, lonB, latB) function could be used to calculate the Haversine distance
between 2 geographic points in kilometres.
The function is intended to be used primarily with the geoPoint field type, but the accepted
arguments could be any plain number or collection field identifier. If the identifier cannot be resolved
and converted to a numeric value, it resolves to null. Note that the
geoDistance function always results in a single row/record value meaning that &quot;any/at-least-one-of&quot;
type of constraint will be applied even if some of its arguments originate from a multiple relation field.
For example:
// offices that are less than 25km from my location (address is a geoPoint field in the offices collection)
geoDistance(address.lon, address.lat, 23.32, 42.69) &lt; 25  #
-Allow only registered users:
@request.auth.id != ""
-Allow only registered users and return records that are either &quot;active&quot; or &quot;pending&quot;:
@request.auth.id != "" &amp;&amp; (status = "active" || status = "pending")
-Allow only registered users who are listed in an allowed_users multi-relation field value:
@request.auth.id != "" &amp;&amp; allowed_users.id ?= @request.auth.id
-Allow access by anyone and return only the records where the title field value starts with
title ~ "Lorem%"

Category: database

Content:
- Working with relations
Working with relations  ### Overview
Let&#39;s assume that we have the following collections structure:
The relation fields follow the same rules as any other collection field and can be set/modified
by directly updating the field value - with a record id or array of ids, in case a multiple relation is used.
Below is an example that shows creating a new posts record with 2 assigned tags.
Dart  import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
const post = await pb.collection('posts').create({
'tags':  ['TAG_ID1', 'TAG_ID2'],
});  import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
final post = await pb.collection('posts').create(body: {
'tags':  ['TAG_ID1', 'TAG_ID2'],
});   ### Prepend/Append to multiple relation
To prepend/append a single or multiple relation id(s) to an existing value you can use the
+ field modifier:
Dart  import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
const post = await pb.collection('posts').update('POST_ID', {
// prepend single tag
'+tags': 'TAG_ID1',
// append multiple tags at once
'tags+': ['TAG_ID1', 'TAG_ID2'],
})  import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
final post = await pb.collection('posts').update('POST_ID', body: {
// prepend single tag
'+tags': 'TAG_ID1',
// append multiple tags at once
'tags+': ['TAG_ID1', 'TAG_ID2'],
})   ### Remove from multiple relation
To remove a single or multiple relation id(s) from an existing value you can use the
- field modifier:
Dart  import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
const post = await pb.collection('posts').update('POST_ID', {
// remove single tag
'tags-': 'TAG_ID1',
// remove multiple tags at once
'tags-': ['TAG_ID1', 'TAG_ID2'],
})  import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
final post = await pb.collection('posts').update('POST_ID', body: {
// remove single tag
'tags-': 'TAG_ID1',
// remove multiple tags at once
'tags-': ['TAG_ID1', 'TAG_ID2'],
})   ### Expanding relations
You can also expand record relation fields directly in the returned response without making additional
requests by using the expand query parameter, e.g. ?expand=user,post.tags
Only the relations that the request client can View (aka. satisfies the relation
collection&#39;s View API Rule) will be expanded.
Nested relation references in expand, filter or sort are supported
via dot-notation and up to 6-levels depth.
For example, to list all comments with their user relation expanded, we can
do the following:
Dart  `await pb.collection("comments").getList(1, 30, { expand: "user" })`  `await pb.collection("comments").getList(perPage: 30, expand: "user")`   {
"page": 1,
"perPage": 30,
"totalPages": 1,
"totalItems": 20,
"items": [
"id": "lmPJt4Z9CkLW36z",
"collectionId": "BHKW36mJl3ZPt6z",
"collectionName": "comments",
"created": "2022-01-01 01:00:00.456Z",
"updated": "2022-01-01 02:15:00.456Z",
"post": "WyAw4bDrvws6gGl",
"user": "FtHAW9feB5rze7D",
"message": "Example message...",
"expand": {
"user": {
"id": "FtHAW9feB5rze7D",
"collectionId": "srmAo0hLxEqYF7F",
"collectionName": "users",
"created": "2022-01-01 00:00:00.000Z",
"updated": "2022-01-01 00:00:00.000Z",
"username": "users54126",
"verified": false,
"emailVisibility": false,
"name": "John Doe"
}  ### Back-relations
PocketBase supports also filter, sort and expand for
back-relations
- relations where the associated relation field is not in the main collection.
The following notation is used: referenceCollection_via_relField (ex.
comments_via_post).
For example, let&#39;s list the posts that have at least one comments record
containing the word &quot;hello&quot;:
Dart  await pb.collection("posts").getList(1, 30, {
filter: "comments_via_post.message ?~ 'hello'"
expand: "comments_via_post.user",
})  await pb.collection("posts").getList(
perPage: 30,
filter: "comments_via_post.message ?~ 'hello'"
expand: "comments_via_post.user",
)   {
"page": 1,
"perPage": 30,
"totalPages": 2,
"totalItems": 45,
"items": [
"id": "WyAw4bDrvws6gGl",
"collectionName": "posts",
"created": "2022-01-01 01:00:00.456Z",
"updated": "2022-01-01 02:15:00.456Z",
"expand": {
"comments_via_post": [
"id": "lmPJt4Z9CkLW36z",
"collectionId": "BHKW36mJl3ZPt6z",
"collectionName": "comments",
"created": "2022-01-01 01:00:00.456Z",
"updated": "2022-01-01 02:15:00.456Z",
"post": "WyAw4bDrvws6gGl",
"user": "FtHAW9feB5rze7D",
"expand": {
"user": {
"id": "FtHAW9feB5rze7D",
"collectionId": "srmAo0hLxEqYF7F",
"collectionName": "users",
"created": "2022-01-01 00:00:00.000Z",
"updated": "2022-01-01 00:00:00.000Z",
"username": "users54126",
"verified": false,
"emailVisibility": false,
"name": "John Doe"
"id": "tu4Z9CkLW36mPJz",
"collectionId": "BHKW36mJl3ZPt6z",
"collectionName": "comments",
"created": "2022-01-01 01:10:00.123Z",
"updated": "2022-01-01 02:39:00.456Z",
"post": "WyAw4bDrvws6gGl",
"user": "FtHAW9feB5rze7D",
"message": "hello...",
"expand": {
"user": {
"id": "FtHAW9feB5rze7D",
"collectionId": "srmAo0hLxEqYF7F",
"collectionName": "users",
"created": "2022-01-01 00:00:00.000Z",
"updated": "2022-01-01 00:00:00.000Z",
"username": "users54126",
"verified": false,
"emailVisibility": false,
"name": "John Doe"
}  ###### Back-relation caveats
-By default the back-relation reference is resolved as a dynamic
multiple relation field, even when the back-relation field itself is marked as
single.
This is because the main record could have more than one single
back-relation reference (see in the above example that the comments_via_post
expand is returned as array, although the original comments.post field is a
single relation).
The only case where the back-relation will be treated as a single
relation field is when there is
UNIQUE index constraint defined on the relation field.
-Back-relation expand is limited to max 1000 records per relation field. If you
need to fetch larger number of back-related records a better approach could be to send a
separate paginated getList() request to the back-related collection to avoid transferring
large JSON payloads and to reduce the memory usage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[14] Introduction - Authentication
URL: https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/
Category: auth

Content:
- Authentication
Authentication  ### Overview
A single client is considered authenticated as long as it sends valid
Authorization:YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN header with the request.
The PocketBase Web APIs are fully stateless and there are no sessions in the traditional sense (even the
tokens are not stored in the database).
Because there are no sessions and we don&#39;t store the tokens on the server there is also no logout
endpoint. To &quot;logout&quot; a user you can simply disregard the token from your local state (aka.
pb.authStore.clear() if you use the SDKs).
The auth token could be generated either through the specific auth collection Web APIs or programmatically
via Go/JS.
All allowed auth collection methods can be configured individually from the specific auth collection
options.
Note that PocketBase admins (aka. _superusers) are similar to the regular auth
collection records with 2 caveats:
-OAuth2 is not supported as auth method for the _superusers collection
-Superusers can access and modify anything (collection API rules are ignored)
### Authenticate with password
To authenticate with password you must enable the Identity/Password auth collection option
(see also
Web API reference
The default identity field is the email but you can configure any other unique field like
&quot;username&quot; (it must have a UNIQUE index).
Dart  import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
// after the above you can also access the auth data from the authStore
console.log(pb.authStore.isValid);
console.log(pb.authStore.token);
console.log(pb.authStore.record.id);
// "logout" the last authenticated record
pb.authStore.clear();  import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
// after the above you can also access the auth data from the authStore
print(pb.authStore.isValid);
print(pb.authStore.token);
print(pb.authStore.record.id);
// "logout" the last authenticated record
pb.authStore.clear();   ### Authenticate with OTP
To authenticate with email code you must enable the One-time password (OTP)
auth collection option
(see also
Web API reference
The usual flow is the user typing manually the received password from their email but you can also
adjust the default email template from the collection options and add a url containing the OTP and its
id as query parameters
Note that when requesting an OTP we return an otpId even if a user with the provided email
doesn&#39;t exist as a very rudimentary enumeration protection (it doesn&#39;t create or send anything).
On successful OTP validation, by default the related user email will be automatically marked as
&quot;verified&quot;.
Keep in mind that OTP as a standalone authentication method could be less secure compared to the
other methods because the generated password is usually 0-9 digits and there is a risk of it being
guessed or enumerated (especially when a longer duration time is configured).
For security critical applications OTP is recommended to be used in combination with the other
auth methods and the Multi-factor authentication option.
Dart  import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
// send OTP email to the provided auth record
// ... show a screen/popup to enter the password from the email ...
// authenticate with the requested OTP id and the email password
const authData = await pb.collection('users').authWithOTP(result.otpId, "YOUR_OTP");
// after the above you can also access the auth data from the authStore
console.log(pb.authStore.isValid);
console.log(pb.authStore.token);
console.log(pb.authStore.record.id);
// "logout"
pb.authStore.clear();  import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
// send OTP email to the provided auth record
// ... show a screen/popup to enter the password from the email ...
// authenticate with the requested OTP id and the email password
final authData = await pb.collection('users').authWithOTP(result.otpId, "YOUR_OTP");
// after the above you can also access the auth data from the authStore
print(pb.authStore.isValid);
print(pb.authStore.token);
print(pb.authStore.record.id);
// "logout"
pb.authStore.clear();   ### Authenticate with OAuth2
You can also authenticate your users with an OAuth2 provider (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, etc.). See the
section below for example integrations.
Before starting, you&#39;ll need to create an OAuth2 app in the provider&#39;s dashboard in order to get a
Client Id and Client Secret, and register a redirect URL
Once you have obtained the Client Id and Client Secret, you can
enable and configure the provider from your PocketBase auth collection options (PocketBase > Collections > {YOUR_COLLECTION} > Edit collection (settings cogwheel) > Options
> OAuth2).
This method handles everything within a single call without having to define custom redirects,
deeplinks or even page reload.
When creating your OAuth2 app, for a callback/redirect URL you have to use the
https://yourdomain.com/api/oauth2-redirect
(or when testing locally - http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/oauth2-redirect ).
Dart  import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('https://pocketbase.io');
// This method initializes a one-off realtime subscription and will
// open a popup window with the OAuth2 vendor page to authenticate.
// Once the external OAuth2 sign-in/sign-up flow is completed, the popup
// window will be automatically closed and the OAuth2 data sent back
// If the popup is being blocked on Safari, make sure that your click handler is not using async/await.
pb.collection('users').authWithOAuth2({
provider: 'google'
}).then((authData) => {
console.log(authData)
// after the above you can also access the auth data from the authStore
console.log(pb.authStore.isValid);
console.log(pb.authStore.token);
console.log(pb.authStore.record.id);
// "logout" the last authenticated record
pb.authStore.clear();
});  import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('https://pocketbase.io');
// This method initializes a one-off realtime subscription and will
// call the provided urlCallback with the OAuth2 vendor url to authenticate.
// Once the external OAuth2 sign-in/sign-up flow is completed, the browser
// window will be automatically closed and the OAuth2 data sent back
// Note that it requires the app and realtime connection to remain active in the background!
// For Android 15+ check the note in https://github.com/pocketbase/dart-sdk#oauth2-and-android-15.
final authData = await pb.collection('users').authWithOAuth2('google', (url) async {
// or use flutter_custom_tabs to make the transitions between native and web content more seamless
await launchUrl(url);
// after the above you can also access the auth data from the authStore
print(pb.authStore.isValid);
print(pb.authStore.token);
print(pb.authStore.record.id);
// "logout" the last authenticated record
pb.authStore.clear();   When authenticating manually with OAuth2 code you&#39;ll need 2 endpoints:
-somewhere to show the &quot;Login with ...&quot; links
-somewhere to handle the provider&#39;s redirect in order to exchange the auth code for token
Here is a simple web example:
-Links page
(e.g. https://127.0.0.1:8090 serving pb_public/index.html):
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
&lt;head>
&lt;meta charset="utf-8" />
&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
&lt;title>OAuth2 links page&lt;/title>
&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.slim.min.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
&lt;ul id="list">
&lt;li>Loading OAuth2 providers...&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;script type="module">
import PocketBase from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pocketbase/js-sdk@master/dist/pocketbase.es.mjs"
const pb          = new PocketBase("http://127.0.0.1:8090");
const redirectURL = "http://127.0.0.1:8090/redirect.html";
const authMethods = await pb.collection("users").listAuthMethods();
const providers   = authMethods.oauth2?.providers || [];
const listItems   = [];
for (const provider of providers) {
const $li = $(`&lt;li>&lt;a>Login with ${provider.name}&lt;/a>&lt;/li>`);
$li.find("a")
.attr("href", provider.authURL + redirectURL)
.data("provider", provider)
.click(function () {
// store provider's data on click for verification in the redirect page
localStorage.setItem("provider", JSON.stringify($(this).data("provider")));
listItems.push($li);
$("#list").html(listItems.length ? listItems : "&lt;li>No OAuth2 providers.&lt;/li>");
&lt;/script>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
-Redirect handler page
(e.g. https://127.0.0.1:8090/redirect.html serving
pb_public/redirect.html):
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
&lt;head>
&lt;meta charset="utf-8">
&lt;title>OAuth2 redirect page&lt;/title>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
&lt;pre id="content">Authenticating...&lt;/pre>
&lt;script type="module">
import PocketBase from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pocketbase/js-sdk@master/dist/pocketbase.es.mjs"
const pb          = new PocketBase("http://127.0.0.1:8090");
const redirectURL = "http://127.0.0.1:8090/redirect.html";
const contentEl   = document.getElementById("content");
// parse the query parameters from the redirected url
const params = (new URL(window.location)).searchParams;
const provider = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("provider"))
// compare the redirect's state param and the stored provider's one
if (provider.state !== params.get("state")) {
contentEl.innerText = "State parameters don't match.";
} else {
// authenticate
pb.collection("users").authWithOAuth2Code(
provider.name,
params.get("code"),
provider.codeVerifier,
redirectURL,
// pass any optional user create data
emailVisibility: false,
).then((authData) => {
contentEl.innerText = JSON.stringify(authData, null, 2);
}).catch((err) => {
contentEl.innerText = "Failed to exchange code.\n" + err;
&lt;/script>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
When using the &quot;Manual code exchange&quot; flow for sign-in with Apple your redirect
handler must accept POST requests in order to receive the name and the
email of the Apple user. If you just need the Apple user id, you can keep the redirect
handler GET but you&#39;ll need to replace in the Apple authorization url
response_mode=form_post with response_mode=query.
### Multi-factor authentication
PocketBase v0.23+ introduced optional Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
If enabled, it requires the user to authenticate with any 2 different auth methods from above (the
order doesn&#39;t matter).
The expected flow is:
-User authenticates with &quot;Auth method A&quot;.
-On success, a 401 response is sent with {"mfaId": "..."} as JSON body (the MFA
&quot;session&quot; is stored in the _mfas system collection).
-User authenticates with &quot;Auth method B&quot; as usual
-On success, a regular auth response is returned, aka. token + auth record data.
Below is an example for email/password + OTP authentication:
Dart  import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
try {
} catch (err) {
const mfaId = err.response?.mfaId;
if (!mfaId) {
throw err; // not mfa -> rethrow
// the user needs to authenticate again with another auth method, for example OTP
// ... show a modal for users to check their email and to enter the received code ...
await pb.collection('users').authWithOTP(result.otpId, 'EMAIL_CODE', { 'mfaId': mfaId });
}  import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
try {
} on ClientException catch (e) {
final mfaId = e.response['mfaId'];
if (mfaId == null) {
throw e; // not mfa -> rethrow
// the user needs to authenticate again with another auth method, for example OTP
// ... show a modal for users to check their email and to enter the received code ...
await pb.collection('users').authWithOTP(result.otpId, 'EMAIL_CODE', query: { 'mfaId': mfaId });
}   ### Users impersonation
Superusers have the option to generate tokens and authenticate as anyone else via the
Impersonate endpoint
The generated impersonate auth tokens can have custom duration but are not renewable!
For convenience the official SDKs creates and returns a standalone client that keeps the token state
in memory, aka. only for the duration of the impersonate client instance.
Dart  import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
// authenticate as superuser
// impersonate
// (the custom token duration is in seconds and it is optional)
const impersonateClient = await pb.collection("users").impersonate("USER_RECORD_ID", 3600)
// log the impersonate token and user data
console.log(impersonateClient.authStore.token);
console.log(impersonateClient.authStore.record);
// send requests as the impersonated user
const items = await impersonateClient.collection("example").getFullList();  import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
// authenticate as superuser
// impersonate
// (the custom token duration is in seconds and it is optional)
final impersonateClient = await pb.collection("users").impersonate("USER_RECORD_ID", 3600)
// log the impersonate token and user data
print(impersonateClient.authStore.token);
print(impersonateClient.authStore.record);
// send requests as the impersonated user
final items = await impersonateClient.collection("example").getFullList();   ### API keys
While PocketBase doesn&#39;t have &quot;API keys&quot; in the traditional sense, as a side effect of the support for
users impersonation, for such cases you can use instead the generated nonrenewable
_superusers impersonate auth token.
You can generate such token via the above impersonate API or from the
Dashboard &gt; Collections &gt; _superusers &gt; {select superuser} &gt; &quot;Impersonate&quot; dropdown option:
Because of the security implications (superusers can execute, access and modify anything), use the
generated _superusers tokens with extreme care and only for internal
server-to-server communication.
To invalidate already issued tokens, you need to change the individual superuser account password
(or if you want to reset the tokens for all superusers - change the shared auth token secret from
the _superusers collection options).
### Auth token verification
PocketBase doesn&#39;t have a dedicated token verification endpoint, but if you want to verify an existing
auth token from a 3rd party app you can send an
Auth refresh
call, aka. pb.collection(&quot;users&quot;).authRefresh().
On valid token - it returns a new token with refreshed exp claim and the latest user data.
Otherwise - returns an error response.
the new one if you don&#39;t need it (as mentioned in the beginning - PocketBase doesn&#39;t store the tokens on the
server).
Performance wise, the used HS256 algorithm for generating the JWT has very little to no
impact and it is essentially the same in terms of response time as calling
getOne(&quot;USER_ID&quot;) (see
benchmarks

[15] Introduction - Files upload and handling
URL: https://pocketbase.io/docs/files-handling/
Category: files

- Files upload and handling
Files upload and handling  ### Uploading files
To upload files, you must first add a file field to your collection:
Once added, you could create/update a Record and upload &quot;documents&quot; files by sending a
multipart/form-data request using the Records create/update APIs.
Each uploaded file will be stored with the original filename (sanitized) and suffixed with a
random part (usually 10 characters). For example test_52iwbgds7l.png.
The max allowed size of a single file currently is limited to ~8GB (253-1 bytes).
Here is an example how to create a new record and upload multiple files to the example &quot;documents&quot;
file field using the SDKs:
Dart  import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
// create a new record and upload multiple files
// (files must be Blob or File instances)
const createdRecord = await pb.collection('example').create({
title: 'Hello world!', // regular text field
'documents': [
new File(['content 1...'], 'file1.txt'),
new File(['content 2...'], 'file2.txt'),
// Alternative FormData + plain HTML file input example
// &lt;input type="file" id="fileInput" />
const fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');
const formData = new FormData();
// set regular text field
formData.append('title', 'Hello world!');
// listen to file input changes and add the selected files to the form data
fileInput.addEventListener('change', function () {
for (let file of fileInput.files) {
formData.append('documents', file);
// upload and create new record
const createdRecord = await pb.collection('example').create(formData);  import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
// create a new record and upload multiple files
final record = await pb.collection('example').create(
body: {
'title': 'Hello world!', // regular text field
files: [
http.MultipartFile.fromString(
'documents',
'example content 1...',
filename: 'file1.txt',
http.MultipartFile.fromString(
'documents',
'example content 2...',
filename: 'file2.txt',
);   If your file field supports uploading multiple files (aka.
Max Files option is &gt;= 2) you can use the + prefix/suffix field name modifier
to respectively prepend/append new files alongside the already uploaded ones. For example:
Dart  import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
const createdRecord = await pb.collection('example').update('RECORD_ID', {
"documents+": new File(["content 3..."], "file3.txt")
});  import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
final record = await pb.collection('example').update(
'RECORD_ID',
files: [
http.MultipartFile.fromString(
'documents+',
'example content 3...',
filename: 'file3.txt',
);   ### Deleting files
To delete uploaded file(s), you could either edit the Record from the Dashboard, or use the API and set
the file field to a zero-value  (empty string, []).
If you want to delete individual file(s) from a multiple file upload field, you could
suffix the field name with - and specify the filename(s) you want to delete. Here are some examples
using the SDKs:
Dart  import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
// delete all "documents" files
await pb.collection('example').update('RECORD_ID', {
'documents': [],
// delete individual files
await pb.collection('example').update('RECORD_ID', {
'documents-': ["file1.pdf", "file2.txt"],
});  import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
// delete all "documents" files
await pb.collection('example').update('RECORD_ID', body: {
'documents': [],
// delete individual files
await pb.collection('example').update('RECORD_ID', body: {
'documents-': ["file1.pdf", "file2.txt"],
});   The above examples use the JSON object data format, but you could also use FormData instance
for multipart/form-data requests. If using
FormData set the file field to an empty string.
### File URL
Each uploaded file could be accessed by requesting its file url:
http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/files/COLLECTION_ID_OR_NAME/RECORD_ID/FILENAME
If your file field has the Thumb sizes option, you can get a thumb of the image file by
adding the thumb
query parameter to the url like this:
http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/files/COLLECTION_ID_OR_NAME/RECORD_ID/FILENAME?thumb=100x300  Currently limited to jpg, png, gif (its first frame) and partially webp (stored as png).
The following thumb formats are currently supported:
-WxH
(e.g. 100x300) - crop to WxH viewbox (from center)
-WxHt
(e.g. 100x300t) - crop to WxH viewbox (from top)
-WxHb
(e.g. 100x300b) - crop to WxH viewbox (from bottom)
-WxHf
(e.g. 100x300f) - fit inside a WxH viewbox (without cropping)
-0xH
(e.g. 0x300) - resize to H height preserving the aspect ratio
-Wx0
(e.g. 100x0) - resize to W width preserving the aspect ratio
The original file would be returned, if the requested thumb size is not found or the file is not an image!
If you already have a Record model instance, the SDKs provide a convenient method to generate a file url
by its name.
Dart  import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
const record = await pb.collection('example').getOne('RECORD_ID');
// get only the first filename from "documents"
// note:
// "documents" is an array of filenames because
// the "documents" field was created with "Max Files" option > 1;
// if "Max Files" was 1, then the result property would be just a string
const firstFilename = record.documents[0];
// returns something like:
// http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/files/example/kfzjt5oy8r34hvn/test_52iWbGinWd.png?thumb=100x250
const url = pb.files.getURL(record, firstFilename, {'thumb': '100x250'});  import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
final record = await pb.collection('example').getOne('RECORD_ID');
// get only the first filename from "documents"
// note:
// "documents" is an array of filenames because
// the "documents" field was created with "Max Files" option > 1;
// if "Max Files" was 1, then the result property would be just a string
final firstFilename = record.getListValue&lt;String>('documents')[0];
// returns something like:
// http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/files/example/kfzjt5oy8r34hvn/test_52iWbGinWd.png?thumb=100x250
### Protected files
By default all files are publicly accessible if you know their full url.
For most applications this is fine and reasonably safe because all files have a random part appended to
their name, but in some cases you may want an extra security to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive
files like ID card or Passport copies, contracts, etc.
To do this you can mark the file field as Protected from its field options in the
Dashboard and then request the file with a special short-lived file token.
Only requests that satisfy the View API rule of the record collection will be able
Dart  import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
// authenticate
// generate a file token
const fileToken = await pb.files.getToken();
// retrieve an example protected file url (will be valid ~2min)
const record = await pb.collection('example').getOne('RECORD_ID');
const url = pb.files.getURL(record, record.myPrivateFile, {'token': fileToken});  import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
// authenticate
// generate a file token
final fileToken = await pb.files.getToken();
// retrieve an example protected file url (will be valid ~2min)
final record = await pb.collection('example').getOne('RECORD_ID');
final url = pb.files.getURL(record, record.getStringValue('myPrivateFile'), token: fileToken);   ### Storage options
By default PocketBase stores uploaded files in the pb_data/storage directory on the local file
system. For the majority of cases this is usually the recommended storage option because it is very fast, easy
to work with and backup.
But if you have limited disk space you could switch to an external S3 compatible storage (AWS S3, MinIO,
Wasabi, DigitalOcean Spaces, Vultr Object Storage, etc.). The easiest way to set up the connection
settings is from the Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; Files storage:

[17] Web APIs reference - API Records
URL: https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-records/
Category: api
API: POST /api/collections/{collection}/records
Parameters:
- collectionIdOrName (String): ID or name of the records' collection.
- page (Number): The page (aka. offset) of the paginated list (default to 1).
- perPage (Number): The max returned records per page (default to 30).
- sort (String): Specify the ORDER BY fields. Add - / + (default) in front of the attribute for DESC /
ASC order, eg.: // DESC by created and ASC by id
?sort=-created,id Supported record sort fields: @random, @rowid, id,
and any other collection field.
- filter (String): Filter expression to filter/search the returned records list (in addition to the
collection's listRule), e.g.: ?filter=(title~'abc' && created>'2022-01-01') Supported record filter fields: id, + any field from the collection schema. The syntax basically follows the format
OPERAND OPERATOR OPERAND, where: OPERAND - could be any field literal, string (single or double quoted),
number, null, true, false OPERATOR - is one of:
= Equal != NOT equal > Greater than >= Greater than or equal < Less than <= Less than or equal ~ Like/Contains (if not specified auto wraps the right string OPERAND in a "%" for wildcard
match) !~ NOT Like/Contains (if not specified auto wraps the right string OPERAND in a "%" for
wildcard match) ?= Any/At least one of Equal ?!= Any/At least one of NOT equal ?> Any/At least one of Greater than ?>= Any/At least one of Greater than or equal ?< Any/At least one of Less than ?<= Any/At least one of Less than or equal ?~ Any/At least one of Like/Contains (if not specified auto wraps the right string OPERAND in a "%" for wildcard
match) ?!~ Any/At least one of NOT Like/Contains (if not specified auto wraps the right string OPERAND in a "%" for
wildcard match) To group and combine several expressions you can use parenthesis
(...), && (AND) and || (OR) tokens. Single line comments are also supported: // Example comment.
- expand (String): Auto expand record relations. Ex.:
?expand=relField1,relField2.subRelField
Supports up to 6-levels depth nested relations expansion.
The expanded relations will be appended to the record under the
expand property (e.g. "expand": {"relField1": {...}, ...}).
Only the relations to which the request user has permissions to view will be expanded.
- fields (String): Comma separated string of the fields to return in the JSON response
(by default returns all fields). Ex.:
?fields=*,expand.relField.name * targets all keys from the specific depth level. In addition, the following field modifiers are also supported: :excerpt(maxLength, withEllipsis?)
Returns a short plain text version of the field string value.
Ex.:
?fields=*,description:excerpt(200,true)
- skipTotal (Boolean): If it is set the total counts query will be skipped and the response fields
totalItems and totalPages will have -1 value.
This could drastically speed up the search queries when the total counters are not needed or cursor based
pagination is used.
For optimization purposes, it is set by default for the
getFirstListItem()
and
getFullList() SDKs methods.
- collectionIdOrName (String): ID or name of the record's collection.
- recordId (String): ID of the record to view.
- expand (String): Auto expand record relations. Ex.:

requests[N].fileField (this is usually handled transparently by the SDKs when their specific object
notation is used)
If you don't use the SDKs or prefer manually to construct the FormData

API Records ### CRUD actions
List/Search records    Returns a paginated records list, supporting sorting and filtering.
Depending on the collection&#39;s listRule value, the access to this action may or may not
have been restricted.
You could find individual generated records API documentation in the &quot;Dashboard &gt; Collections
&gt; API Preview&quot;.
Dart  import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
// fetch a paginated records list
const resultList = await pb.collection('posts').getList(1, 50, {
filter: 'created >= "2022-01-01 00:00:00" &amp;&amp; someField1 != someField2',
// you can also fetch all records at once via getFullList
const records = await pb.collection('posts').getFullList({
sort: '-created',
// or fetch only the first record that matches the specified filter
const record = await pb.collection('posts').getFirstListItem('someField="test"', {

);   ###### API details
GET /api/collections/`collectionIdOrName`/records Path parameters Param Type Description collectionIdOrName String ID or name of the records&#39; collection. Query parameters Param Type Description page Number The page (aka. offset) of the paginated list (default to 1). perPage Number The max returned records per page (default to 30). sort String Specify the ORDER BY fields.
Add - / + (default) in front of the attribute for DESC /
ASC order, eg.:
// DESC by created and ASC by id
?sort=-created,id  Supported record sort fields:  @random, @rowid, id,
and any other collection field.
filter String Filter expression to filter/search the returned records list (in addition to the
collection&#39;s listRule), e.g.:
`?filter=(title~'abc' &amp;&amp; created>'2022-01-01')`  Supported record filter fields:  id, + any field from the collection schema.
The syntax basically follows the format
OPERAND OPERATOR OPERAND, where:
-OPERAND - could be any field literal, string (single or double quoted),
number, null, true, false
-OPERATOR - is one of:
= Equal
-!= NOT equal
-> Greater than
->= Greater than or equal
-&lt; Less than
-&lt;= Less than or equal
-~ Like/Contains (if not specified auto wraps the right string OPERAND in a &quot;%&quot; for wildcard
match)
-!~ NOT Like/Contains (if not specified auto wraps the right string OPERAND in a &quot;%&quot; for
wildcard match)
-?= Any/At least one of Equal
-?!= Any/At least one of NOT equal
-?> Any/At least one of Greater than
-?>= Any/At least one of Greater than or equal
-?&lt; Any/At least one of Less than
-?&lt;= Any/At least one of Less than or equal
-?~ Any/At least one of Like/Contains (if not specified auto wraps the right string OPERAND in a &quot;%&quot; for wildcard
match)
-?!~ Any/At least one of NOT Like/Contains (if not specified auto wraps the right string OPERAND in a &quot;%&quot; for
wildcard match)
To group and combine several expressions you can use parenthesis
(...), &amp;&amp; (AND) and || (OR) tokens.
Single line comments are also supported: // Example comment.
expand String Auto expand record relations. Ex.:
`?expand=relField1,relField2.subRelField`
Supports up to 6-levels depth nested relations expansion.

`expand` property (e.g. `"expand": {"relField1": {...}, ...}`).
Only the relations to which the request user has permissions to view will be expanded. fields String Comma separated string of the fields to return in the JSON response
(by default returns all fields). Ex.:
?fields=*,expand.relField.name
* targets all keys from the specific depth level.
In addition, the following field modifiers are also supported:
-:excerpt(maxLength, withEllipsis?)
Returns a short plain text version of the field string value.
Ex.:
?fields=*,description:excerpt(200,true)
skipTotal Boolean If it is set the total counts query will be skipped and the response fields
`totalItems` and `totalPages` will have `-1` value.
This could drastically speed up the search queries when the total counters are not needed or cursor based
pagination is used.
For optimization purposes, it is set by default for the
`getFirstListItem()`
and
`getFullList()` SDKs methods. Responses  {

}      Batch create/update/upsert/delete records    Batch and transactional create/update/upsert/delete of multiple records in a single request.
The batch Web API need to be explicitly enabled and configured from the
Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; Application.
Because this endpoint processes the requests in a single read&amp;write transaction, other queries
may queue up and it could degrade the performance of your application if not used with proper
care and configuration
(some recommendations: prefer using the smallest possible max processing time and body
size limits; avoid large file uploads over slow S3 networks and custom hooks that
communicate with slow external APIs).
Dart  import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';

final result = await batch.send();   ###### API details
POST /api/batch Body Parameters Body parameters could be sent as application/json or multipart/form-data.
File upload is supported only via multipart/form-data (see below for more details).
Param Description Required requests Array&lt;Request> - List of the requests to process.
The supported batch request actions are:
-record create - POST /api/collections/{collection}/records
-record update -
PATCH /api/collections/{collection}/records/{id}
-record upsert - PUT /api/collections/{collection}/records  (the body must have id field)
-record delete -
DELETE /api/collections/{collection}/records/{id}
Each batch Request element have the following properties:
-url path (could include query parameters)
-method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
-headers  (custom per-request Authorization header is not supported at the moment,
aka. all batch requests have the same auth state)
-body
NB! When the batch request is send as
multipart/form-data, the regular batch action fields are expected to be
submitted as serialized json under the @jsonPayload field and file keys
need to follow the pattern requests.N.fileField or
requests[N].fileField (this is usually handled transparently by the SDKs when their specific object
notation is used)
If you don&#39;t use the SDKs or prefer manually to construct the FormData
body, then it could look something like:
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("@jsonPayload", JSON.stringify({
requests: [
method: "POST",
url: "/api/collections/example/records?expand=user",
body: { title: "test1" },
method: "PATCH",
url: "/api/collections/example/records/RECORD_ID",
body: { title: "test2" },
method: "DELETE",
url: "/api/collections/example/records/RECORD_ID",
// file for the first request
formData.append("requests.0.document", new File(...))
// file for the second request
formData.append("requests.1.document", new File(...))

Parameters:
- Required clientId (String): ID of the SSE client connection.
- Optional subscriptions (Array<String>): The new client subscriptions to set in the format:
COLLECTION_ID_OR_NAME or
COLLECTION_ID_OR_NAME/RECORD_ID. You can also attach optional query and header parameters as serialized json to a

# Web APIs reference - API Realtime
- **Required clientId** (String): ID of the SSE client connection.
- **Optional subscriptions** (Array<String>): The new client subscriptions to set in the format:
COLLECTION_ID_OR_NAME or
COLLECTION_ID_OR_NAME/RECORD_ID. You can also attach optional query and header parameters as serialized json to a
single topic using the options
query parameter, e.g.:
COLLECTION_ID_OR_NAME/RECORD_ID?options={"query": {"abc": "123"}, "headers": {"x-token": "..."}} Leave empty to unsubscribe from everything.
API Realtime The Realtime API is implemented via Server-Sent Events (SSE). Generally, it consists of 2 operations:
-establish SSE connection
-submit client subscriptions
SSE events are sent for create, update
and delete record operations.
You could subscribe to a single record or to an entire collection.
When you subscribe to a single record, the collection&#39;s
ViewRule will be used to determine whether the subscriber has access to receive the
event message.
When you subscribe to an entire collection, the collection&#39;s
ListRule will be used to determine whether the subscriber has access to receive the
event message.
Connect    GET /api/realtime Establishes a new SSE connection and immediately sends a PB_CONNECT SSE event with the
created client ID.
NB! The user/superuser authorization happens during the first
Set subscriptions
call.
If the connected client doesn&#39;t receive any new messages for 5 minutes, the server will send a
disconnect signal (this is to prevent forgotten/leaked connections). The connection will be
automatically reestablished if the client is still active (e.g. the browser tab is still open).
If Authorization header is set, will authorize the client SSE connection with the
associated user or superuser.
Body Parameters Param Type Description Required clientId String ID of the SSE client connection. Optional subscriptions Array&lt;String> The new client subscriptions to set in the format:
COLLECTION_ID_OR_NAME or
COLLECTION_ID_OR_NAME/RECORD_ID.
You can also attach optional query and header parameters as serialized json to a
single topic using the options
query parameter, e.g.:
COLLECTION_ID_OR_NAME/RECORD_ID?options={"query": {"abc": "123"}, "headers": {"x-token": "..."}}
Leave empty to unsubscribe from everything.
Body parameters could be sent as JSON or
multipart/form-data. Responses  `null`  {

API: GET /api/collections/_pbc_2287844090/records?page=1&amp;perPage=1&amp;filter=&amp;fields=id"
Parameters:
- page (Number): The page (aka. offset) of the paginated list (default to 1).
- perPage (Number): The max returned logs per page (default to 30).
- sort (String): Specify the ORDER BY fields. Add - / + (default) in front of the attribute for DESC /
ASC order, e.g.: // DESC by the insertion rowid and ASC by level
?sort=-rowid,level Supported log sort fields: @random, rowid, id, created,
updated, level, message and any
data.* attribute.
- filter (String): Filter expression to filter/search the returned logs list, e.g.: ?filter=(data.url~'test.com' && level>0) Supported log filter fields: id, created, updated,
level, message and any data.* attribute. The syntax basically follows the format
OPERAND OPERATOR OPERAND, where: OPERAND - could be any field literal, string (single or double quoted),
number, null, true, false OPERATOR - is one of:
= Equal != NOT equal > Greater than >= Greater than or equal < Less than <= Less than or equal ~ Like/Contains (if not specified auto wraps the right string OPERAND in a "%" for wildcard

wildcard match) To group and combine several expressions you can use parenthesis
(...), && (AND) and || (OR) tokens. Single line comments are also supported: // Example comment.
- fields (String): Comma separated string of the fields to return in the JSON response
(by default returns all fields). Ex.:
?fields=*,expand.relField.name * targets all keys from the specific depth level. In addition, the following field modifiers are also supported: :excerpt(maxLength, withEllipsis?)
Returns a short plain text version of the field string value.
Ex.:
?fields=*,description:excerpt(200,true)
